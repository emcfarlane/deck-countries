Where in the world is **Guinea**?
<!--question-->
Guinea, officially the **Republic of Guinea**, is a west-coastal country in West Africa. Formerly known as French Guinea, the modern country is sometimes referred to as **Guinea-Conakry** to distinguish it from other countries with "Guinea" in the name and the eponymous region, such as Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea.
